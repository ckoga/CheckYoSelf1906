# Check Yo Self

## Learning Goals

Check Yo Self is designed to test our abilities in data manipulation, event handling while following a style guide.  Creating objects and passing them back and forth to localStorage tests how well we can keep our code dry and organized.  Using the data model to update the properties of our objects strengthens our understandind of how the data effects the DOM.  Accessing the data model to update properties helps to highlight how OOP has developed over time and is a great step into working with larger data sets in Mod 2.
